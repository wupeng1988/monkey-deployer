# monkey-deployer

Writing with spring shell and jsch expect4j. This project was supposed to have two main functions: 

1. Sendding shell command to multiple machines at same time and show the console output. 
2. Each machine has dependened sessions.


But later I found the **[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)** tool, which meet my needs completely, so this project will be suspend temporary.
